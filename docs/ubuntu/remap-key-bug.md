# Remap Key Bug

I check `Swap Ctrl and Caps Lock`, which is under `Ctrl position` -> `Additional Layout Options` -> `Keyboard & Mouse` -> `GNOME Tweaks`.

But it's lost when I reboot the PC recently.

I found talks about it officially and unofficially:

- <https://askubuntu.com/questions/1286997/caps-lock-remapping-stops-working>
- <https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/mutter/+bug/1899206>

A way to recover it:

<kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>F2</kbd> -> Type `r` -> hit <kbd>enter</kbd>, so it works again until it breaks again.
