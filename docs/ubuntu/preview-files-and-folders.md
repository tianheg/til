# Preview Files And Folders

[source](https://help.ubuntu.com/stable/ubuntu-help/files-preview.html.en)

Install `Sushi`: [install](apt:gnome-sushi)

You can quickly preview files without opening them in a full\-blown application. Select any file and press the space bar. The file will open in a simple preview window. Press the space bar again to dismiss the preview.

The built\-in preview supports most file formats for documents, images, video, and audio. In the preview, you can scroll through your documents or seek through your video and audio.

To view a preview full\-screen, press <kbd>F</kbd> or <kbd>F11</kbd>. Press <kbd>F</kbd> or <kbd>F11</kbd> again to leave full\-screen, or press the space bar to exit the preview completely.
