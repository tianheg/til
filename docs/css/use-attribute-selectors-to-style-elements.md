# Use Attribute Selectors To Style Elements

There are other CSS Selectors you can use to select custom groups of elements to style.

For this challenge, you will use the `[attr=value]` attribute selector to style the checkboxes in CatPhotoApp. This selector matches and styles elements with a specific attribute value. For example, the below code changes the margins of all elements with the attribute `type` and a corresponding value of `radio`:

```css
[type='radio'] {
  margin: 20px 0px 20px 0px;
}
```
