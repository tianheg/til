# Create Your First CSS Grid

Turn any HTML element into a grid container by setting its `display` property to `grid`. This gives you the ability to use all the other properties associated with CSS Grid.

**Note**: In CSS Grid, the parent element is referred to as the container and its children are called items.

`display: grid;`
