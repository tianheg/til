# Set The Id Of An Element

```html
<form id="id">
</form>
```

There are several benefits to using `id` attributes: You can use an `id` to style a single element and later you'll learn that you can use them to select and modify specific elements with JavaScript.

`id` attributes should be unique. Browsers won't enforce this, but it is a widely agreed upon best practice. So please don't give more than one element the same `id` attribute.
