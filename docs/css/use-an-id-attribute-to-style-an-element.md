# Use An Id Attribute To Style An Element

```css
#cat-photo-element {
  background-color: green;
}
```

An `id` is not reusable and should only be applied to one element.

An `id` also has a higher specificity (importance) than a class so if both are applied to the same element and have conflicting styles, the styles of the `id` will be applied.
