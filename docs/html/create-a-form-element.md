# Create A Form Element

```html
<form action="https://freecatphotoapp.com/submit-cat-photo">
    <input type="text" placeholder="cat photo URL">
</form>
```

You can build web forms that actually submit data to a server using nothing more than pure HTML. You can do this by specifying an action attribute on your form element.
