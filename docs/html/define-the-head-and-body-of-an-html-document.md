# Define The Head And Body Of An HTML Document

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <!-- metadata elements -->
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- page contents -->
  </body>
</html>
```

You can add another level of organization in your HTML document within the `html` tags with the `head` and `body` elements. Any markup with information about your page would go into the `head` tag. Then any markup with the content of the page (what displays for a user) would go into the `body` tag.
