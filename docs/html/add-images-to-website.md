# Add Images To Website

Just input:

```html
<img src="https://www.freecatphotoapp.com/your-image.jpg">
<img src="https://bit.ly/fcc-relaxing-cat" alt="A Cute Cat">
```

Note that `img` elements are self-closing.

All `img` elements **must** have an `alt` attribute. The text inside an `alt` attribute is used for screen readers to improve accessibility and is displayed if the image fails to load.

**Note:** If the image is purely decorative, using an empty `alt` attribute is a best practice.

Ideally the `alt` attribute should not contain special characters unless needed.
