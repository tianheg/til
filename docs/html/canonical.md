# Canonical

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia: [Canonical_link_element](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canonical_link_element)

A canonical link element is an HTML element that helps webmasters prevent duplicate content issues by specifying the "canonical" or "preferred" version of a web page as part of search engine optimization.
