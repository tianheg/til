# What Is HTML And HTML5

**What is HTML**?

HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is a markup language used to describe the structure of a web page. It uses a special syntax or notation to organize and give information about the page to the browser. Elements usually have opening and closing tags that surround and give meaning to content. For example, there are different tag options to place around text to show whether it is a heading, a paragraph, or a list.

For example:

```html
<h1>Top level heading: Maybe a page title</h1>

<p>A paragraph of text. Some information we would like to communicate to the viewer. This can be as long or short as we would like.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Number one on the list</li>
  <li>Number two</li>
  <li>A third item</li>
</ol>
```

Becomes:

```md
# Top level heading: Maybe a page title

A paragraph of text. Some information we would like to communicate to the user. This can be as long or short as we would like.

1. Number one on the list
2. Number two
3. A third item
```

**What is HTML5**?

As web pages and web applications grow more complex, the W3 Consortium updates the HTML specification to ensure that a webpage can be shown reliably on any browser. **The latest version of HTML is HTML5**.

Its goals were to improve the language with support for the latest multimedia and other new features; to keep the language both easily readable by humans and consistently understood by computers and devices such as web browsers, parsers, etc., without XHTML's rigidity; and to remain backward-compatible with older software. HTML5 is intended to subsume not only HTML 4 but also XHTML 1 and DOM Level 2 HTML.

**HTML5 Features**:

- Markup
- New APIs
- XHTML 5 (XML-serialized HTML 5)
- Error handling
- Popularity
- Differences from HTML 4.01 and XHTML 1.x

HTML5 introduces more descriptive HTML tags. These include `main`, `header`, `footer`, `nav`, `video`, `article`, `section` and others.

These tags give a descriptive structure to your HTML, make your HTML easier to read, and help with Search Engine Optimization (SEO) and accessibility. The `main` HTML5 tag helps search engines and other developers find the main content of your page.

Many of the new HTML5 tags and their benefits are covered in the `freecodecamp` Applied Accessibility section.
