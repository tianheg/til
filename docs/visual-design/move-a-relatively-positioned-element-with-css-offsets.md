# Move A Relatively Positioned Element With CSS Offsets

The CSS offsets of `top` or `bottom`, and `left` or `right` tell the browser how far to offset an item relative to where it would sit in the normal flow of the document.

```css
h2 {
    position: relative;
    left: 15px;
    bottom: 10px;
}
```
