# Add A Text Alternative To Images For Visually Impaired Accessibility

`alt` text describes the content of the image and provides a text\-alternative for it. This helps in cases where the image fails to load or can't be seen by a user.

It's also used by search engines to understand what an image contains to include it in search results.
