# Use Tabindex To Specify The Order Of Keyboard Focus For Several Elements

```html
<div tabindex="1">I get keyboard focus, and I get it first!</div>
<div tabindex="2">I get keyboard focus, and I get it second!</div>
```

This technique may be necessary in some circumstances, but in terms of accessibility, take care before applying it.
