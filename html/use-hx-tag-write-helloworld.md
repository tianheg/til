# Use Hx Tag Write Helloworld

`x`'s scope: 1-6

Just input:

```html
<h1>Helloworld</h1>
<h2>Helloworld</h2>
<h3>Helloworld</h3>
<h4>Helloworld</h4>
<h5>Helloworld</h5>
<h6>Helloworld</h6>
```

The `h2` element you will be adding in this step will add a level two heading to the web page.

This element tells the browser about the structure of your website. `h1` elements are often used for main headings, while `h2` elements are generally used for subheadings. There are also `h3`, `h4`, `h5`and `h6` elements to indicate different levels of subheadings.

Most HTML elements have an opening tag and a closing tag. The only difference between opening and closing tags is the forward slash[^1] after the opening bracket of a closing tag.
