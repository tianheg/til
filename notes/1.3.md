# DNS

**DNS** (**Domain Name System**) is a hierarchical(分层的) and decentralized(去中心的) naming system for Internet connected resources. DNS maintains a list of domain names along with the resources, such as IP addresses, that are associated with them.

The most prominent function of DNS is the translation of human-friendly domain names (such as mozilla.org) to a numeric IP address (such as 151.106.5.172); this process of mapping a domain name to the appropriate IP address is known as a **DNS lookup**. By contrast, a **reverse DNS lookup** (rDNS) is used to determine the domain name associated with an IP address.
