# Use A Retina Image For Higher Resolution Displays

The simplest way to make your images properly appear on High\-Resolution Displays, such as the MacBook Pros "retina display" is to define their `width` and `height` values as only half of what the original file is. Here is an example of an image that is only using half of the original height and width:

```html
<style> img { height: 250px; width: 250px; } </style> <img src="coolPic500x500" alt="A most excellent picture">
```
