# TIL <!-- omit in toc -->

> Today I Learned

A collection of concise write-ups on small things I learn day to day across a
variety of languages and technologies. These are things that don't really
warrant a full blog post. These are things I've picked up by [Learning In Public™](https://dev.to/jbranchaud/how-i-built-a-learning-machine-45k9).

Understanding about TIL:

- must be short
- only one concept or problem
- add source when meeting other places
- use `>` before the command, maybe not
  
  example:

  ```bash
  > git checkout qa
  > git checkout -b new-branch
  fatal: A branch named 'new-branch' already exists.
  ```

_21 TILs and counting..._
