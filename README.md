> Today I Learned

> 今天我学了……

A collection of concise write-ups on small things I learn day to day across a
variety of languages and technologies. These are things that don't really
warrant a full blog post. These are things I've picked up by [Learning In Public™](https://dev.to/jbranchaud/how-i-built-a-learning-machine-45k9).

这是一组关于我每天学习的各种语言和技术的小事物的简明评论。这些还不足以构成一篇完整的博客。这些是我从公开学习中获得的东西。
