# LORE - Portal Lore in a Minute

[source](https://youtu.be/dteP3QK7JKA)

In the year 1947 Aperture Science Enrichment Center was created to make shower curtains for the US Military.

The owner, Cave Johnson, fell ill thanks to his secret production of a Conversion Gel made from Lunar rocks, prompting him to produce a three-tiered research program to ensure the longevity of his company.

First, The Heimlich Counter Maneuver.

Second, The Take-A-Wish Foundation and third, The Portal Project which included the making of the Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device.

The latter was endlessly funded by the Senate and Johnson went on to... well, die.

Fast forward many years later when an AI research assistant known as "Genetic Lifeform and Disk Operating System", aka GLaDOS, is activated on the Enrichment Center's first Bring Your Daughter To Work day.

After releasing a neuro-toxin, locking everyone inside and taking over the facility, GLaDOS is equipped with a morality core to keep her dickish impulses in line.

The morality core is a failure, shock.

And thus, the Aperture Test Chambers were created for GLaDOS's enjoyment.

The remaining employees were forced to further develop and test the Poral Project using the nifty portal guns.

It's unknown how long those poor souls lasted in the nearly abandoned Enrichment Center but eventually GLaDOS finds herself with only one test subject left, Chell, who GLaDOS wakes up from her stasis bed.

GLaDOS tells Chell she's trapped in the Enrichment Center and must make her way through the test chambers and so, the adventure that is Portal BEGINS!

Good job! Have fun!

老板凯夫-约翰逊因为秘密生产了一种用月球岩石制成的转换凝胶而病倒，促使他产生了一个三层研究计划，以确保公司的长久发展。

第一，"海姆立克反演习"。

第二，Take-A-Wish 基金会，第三，传送门计划，其中包括制作光圈科学手持传送门装置。

后者得到了参议院无休止的资助，而约翰逊则继续……嗯，死了。

快进很多年后，一个被称为 "基因生命体和磁盘操作系统 "的人工智能研究助手，也就是 GLaDOS，在丰富中心的第一个带女儿上班日被激活。

在释放出神经毒素，将所有人锁在里面并接管设施后，GLaDOS 配备了一个道德核心，以保持她的屌丝冲动。

道德核心是失败的，震惊。

于是，光圈试验室就这样诞生了，供 GLaDOS 享用。

其余的员工被迫使用那些精巧的传送门枪进一步开发和测试波拉尔计划。

不知道那些可怜的灵魂在几乎被遗弃的充实中心持续了多久，但最终 GLaDOS 发现自己只剩下一个测试对象，Chell，GLaDOS 从她的静止床上醒来。

GLaDOS 告诉 Chell 她被困在了充实中心，她必须穿过测试室，于是，传送门的冒险之旅开始了。

幹得好！祝你們玩得愉快！
