# Login After Losing Recovery Codes

I enabled my 2FA with Cloudflare, and I don't know authenticator app codes or recovery codes. So I can't access my account.

I emailed `support@cloudflare.com` with:

```text
The list of domains (1 or more) in your account
The IP address(es) for the web server(s) associated with each those domain(s) (1 or more)
Who your hosting provider is for each of those domain(s) (1 or more)
What your original name servers were for each of those domain(s) (1 or more)
For Authy, the phone number you used to activate Authy on your Cloudflare account
```
