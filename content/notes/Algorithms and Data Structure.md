# Algorithms and Data Structure

## Data Structures

A data structure is a particular way of organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently. More precisely, a data structure is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data.

`B` - Beginner, `A` - Advanced

- `B` [[Linked List]]
- `B` [[Doubly Linked List]]
- `B` [[Queue]]
- `B` [[Stack]]
- `B` [[Hash Table]]
- `B` [[Heap]] - max and min heap versions
- `B` [[Priority Queue]]
- `A` [[Trie]]
- `A` [[Tree]]
  - `A` [[Binary Search Tree]]
  - `A` [[AVL Tree]]
  - `A` [[Red-Black Tree]]
  - `A` [[Segment Tree]] - with min/max/sum range queries examples
  - `A` [[Fenwick Tree]] (Binary Indexed Tree)
- `A` [[Graph]] (both directed and undirected)
- `A` [[Disjoint Set]]
- `A` [[Bloom Filter]]
